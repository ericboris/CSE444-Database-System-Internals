Lab 4 implements log-based rollback and recovery.
It also changes the buffer management policy to NOFORCE so that dirty pages are not forced to flush to disk after commit.
These changes make SimpleDB more efficient by avoiding unnecessary disk accesses.

Changes include:
    Rollback:
        Compile the set of relevant tids into a log and undo the changes to their states.

    Recover: 
        Revert the commit state of the database. 
        Use redo to redo committed pages.
        Use undo to undo uncommitted pages.

    Undo:
        Iterate over the log and set previously updated pages to a pre-updated state.

    Redo:
        Iterate over the log and update their states.

    BufferPool:
        Switch to NOFORCE policy.
        Update evictPage():
            remove dirty-page check before flush.
        Update transactionComplete():
            add logging.

Design Decisions:
    Undo:
        Abstract the undo functionality required by both rollback and recovery into a method.
        This allows single transaction undo in rollback and multiple transaction undo in recovery. 

    No were made outside of BufferPool and LogFile.

Unit Test:
    Three transactions: 
        T1, T2, and T3. 
        T1 inserts and aborts. 
        T2 inserts and commits. 
        T3 inserts and does not commit. 
        Only T2 is present.
